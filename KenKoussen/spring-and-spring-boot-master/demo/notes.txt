During start-up, Spring:

1. Reads all bean definitions from all sources (annotations, @Bean methods, XML)
2. Post-processes the definitions (insert @Value from properties file)
3. Instatiates and wires together all the beans
4. Post-processes the beans --> generates any needed proxies, like for transactions

That's how Spring applied declarative services to bean methods

High-level architecture of every Java web app ever:

Presentation layer (controllers and views)
||
Service layer (business logic and transaction boundaries)
||
Persistence layer (converts Java classes to tables and back)
||
DB
