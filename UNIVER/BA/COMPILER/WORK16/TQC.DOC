   How produce Tqc.exe from the source files.
   Project writen using C language compiler version 2.0.
   For producing exe file you need Borland C compile installed onto yours Pc ,
   and the system directory of the compiler should be include in path.
   Check the file maketqc placed in the sub directory SRC\ where placed all
   the source files. There are defined variables you have to change for
   compile sources files.

   List of variables you may need to change:

   TCROOT = c:\TC2.0  directory C compiler installed.
   APPNAME = TQC      name of application.
   INCPATH = $(TCROOT)\include directory of include files
   LIBPATH = $(TCROOT)\lib     directory of library files
   CC = $(TCROOT)\tcc.exe      name of compiler program

   After you have checked maketqc file , you can run make for
   produce TQC.EXE file.Change directory to the directory where
   source files are.Run program make.

   Command line:
   make -fmaketqc

   It is possible make exe file using turbo C enviroment.
   Use file tqc.PRJ then and be sure that compiler model is large.
